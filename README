DIRBIRD
-------
An color text art editor. Uses the libcaca ruby bindings.

Currently, the libcaca ruby bindings only work with ruby 1.8.7.
This program also needs a patch for the ruby bindings, which is only
in a branch in my libcaca fork called 'ruby-stuffs', for now.

Works best with the x11 driver.
